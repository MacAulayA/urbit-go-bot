# urbit-go
The abstract board-game Go, now on Urbit

## Installation

The app is available from [~disreb-winner-mittec/urbit-go](web+urbitgraph://~disreb-winner-mittec/urbit-go)

## Building

Begin by spinning up a fakezod

You will need to clone the urbit repository from github here: https://github.com/urbit/urbit

For the sake of this installation, this cloned repo is referred to as 'urbit-git'

### Creating the base desk

In your fakezod, create the skeleton desk by running `|merge %urbit-go our %base` and `|mount %urbit-go`

Once that is done, on the unix side, navigate to your pier and delete the contents on the 'urbit-go' folder. Then copy the contents of
base-dev and garden-dev in urbit-git/pkg to the now-empty urbit-go folder. Create an app/ and gen/ folder as well.

### Adding gall files

Run the install script `install.sh` to copy files from the repository to your pier's folder, or vice-versa.

Then run `|commit %urbit-go` and finally `|install our %urbit-go`

It will ask for a glob file. Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8080/docket/upload (or wherever you host your fakezod). Then select 'urbit-go'
as the app, and upload the 'urbit-go-glob' folder in this repository. If all goes well, you'll have a working install.

**Note:** If you are not running this on a fakezod, you will need to update desk.docket-0 glob-ames to the name of your ship

## Progress

The app works, notifications coming soon(tm)

The Front-end repository is [here](https://github.com/Vrend/urbit-go-frontend), but has been built into the glob folder of this repository.
